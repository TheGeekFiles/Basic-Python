# Basic-Python
These Python projects are really basic, so you can test if Python installed properly.

# How to download
Simply clone this repo and run the .py script. You may need to make it an executable file if you are running this on Linux.

# Credits
I wrote the basic script, but Python belongs to the respected owners.
